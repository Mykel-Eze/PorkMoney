                            Part of PorkMoneyâ€™s 9 month goal is the acquisition of bio-digesters to help in the waste management as well as reduce our
                            dependence on the National grid and other diesel generators for electricity. The Bio-digesters serve two
                            very important purpose.
                            <ol>
                                <li>Reduce the methane emission from the farm. The methane emission is what the pig waste give off and</li>
                                <li>Turn the waste into electricity for consumption on the farm and most especially for our processing plant.</li>
                            </ol>
                            We would be one of the few livestock farms in the country with a functional bio-digester, effectively changing the narrative
                            about Pig farming being a messy and odorous affair.
